# Covid-19 Data Analysis Project Using SQL Server

**Project Overview:**
This project is about COVID-19 cases, Deaths & Vaccinations, the dataset utilized in this project is sourced from the Kaggle. In this project, I created a New Database, imported a Dataset from a Device, and worked on different types of Questions to “Retrieve valuable Insights” from the Data. I did this project in **SSMS**using **“SQL Server”**. The Dataset Contains **“16 Columns”** and  **”85K+ ‘ Rows”**. To do this Project I **“Used SQL Aggregate Functions”, “SQL Clauses”,  “SQL Wildcards”, “String Functions” & “SQL JOINS”.**

**Purpose of Project:**
The main goal of this project is to determine the Total Number of people infected with COVID-19, the Total number of Deaths, the number of New Cases, the number of New Deaths, the number of People Vaccinated, Which Country Is Most Affected, etc.

**Few SQL Commend I used in this project:**                                                           
**(DDL) Data Definition Language:** CREATE, ALTER, DROP, TRUNCATE & RENAME.                                          
**(DML) Data Manipulation Language:** INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE                                       
**(DQL) Data Query Language:** SELECT (“FROM, WHERE, ORDER BY, GROUP BY, HAVING, DISTINCT, JOIN,                                   
BETWEEN, LIKE, IN, IS NULL”) etc..                            

**Few Questions I Used to retrieve Valuable insight:**                                                            
•	Total Cases vs Total Deaths in 'India
